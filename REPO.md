# Kelci Jenkins - Continuous Integration (Part 4.d.)
- I implemented continuous integration (CI) in our GitHub repo utilizing GitHub actions. From the lessons learned in class, I ended up using Codacy with GitHub code scanning to ensure each commit and pull request to the main branch is being analyzed and reported. Throughout this process, static code analysis is being utilized, reported, and uploaded to GitHub. To do this, I used resources from class, experience from workshop 9, and the Codacy documentation.
- I learned about the use cases of Codacy and how the information learned can be adapted to other CI workflows. I learned that even without GitHub Actions, similar results can be achieved by creating a custom YAML file and implementing CI directly through YAML-based configurations. Also learned to make sure the branch name in the YAML file matches the repo branches that you want to monitor. If not, it will not work. Made the mistake of having the branch name as "master", but the branch name was "main" so it did not work at first.
